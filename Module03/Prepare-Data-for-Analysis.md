# ðŸ§¹ Module 3 Summary: Prepare Data for Analysis

In this module, I learned how to **prepare raw data** for analysis â€” a crucial step in any data analysis or data science workflow.
I explored how to clean, transform, and shape data using powerful tools like **Pandas**, **Watson Studio**, and **OpenRefine**.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings

### 1. Importance of Data Preparation
- Raw data is often messy, incomplete, or inconsistent.
- Data preparation ensures accuracy, quality, and usability for downstream analysis and modeling.

### 2. Common Data Quality Issues
- **Missing values**
- **Inconsistent formats**
- **Duplicated rows**
- **Outliers**
- **Incorrect data types**

### 3. Data Cleaning Techniques
- Removing or filling in **missing values** (`NaN`)
- Correcting **data types**
- Removing **duplicates**
- Standardizing **categorical values**
- Handling **outliers**


### 4. Data Transformation Techniques
- **Normalization**: Scaling data to fit within a certain range (e.g., 0 to 1).
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data (e.g., averages, totals).
- **Filtering**: Selecting rows based on specific conditions.
- **Grouping**: Using `groupby()` to segment data and apply functions.
- **Unions vs Joins**:
  - **Unions** combine rows from tables with the same structure.
  - **Joins** merge columns from different tables based on a key.

### 5. Tools for Data Preparation
- **Pandas**: Python library to clean, manipulate, and explore data efficiently.
- **Watson Studio Data Refinery**: GUI-based tool for cleaning and transforming data.
- **OpenRefine**: Free open-source tool for data cleanup and transformation.

### 6. Best Practices
- Always inspect your dataset first (e.g., using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).
- Document every step of the data cleaning process.
- Validate the quality of the transformed data before proceeding to analysis.

## ðŸš€ Outcome
By completing this module, I am now confident in preparing raw datasets into clean, structured, and analysis-ready formats using both
**code-based (Pandas)** and **GUI-based (Watson Studio Data Refinery)** tools.

This foundational skill enables better insights, accurate modeling, and smoother workflows in any data project.
